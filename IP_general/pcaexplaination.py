> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a useful technique for dimensionality
reduction and is optimal in the sense that it represents the variability of the
training data with as few dimensions as possible.

> The projection matrix resulting from PCA can be seen as a change of
coordinates to a coordinate system where the coordinates are in
descending order of importance.

> The flattened images are collected in a single matrix by stacking them,
one row for each image. The rows are then centered relative to the mean
image before the computation of the dominant directions.

> To find the principal components, singular value decomposition (SVD) is
usually used, but if the dimensionality is high, there is a useful trick that
can be used instead since the SVD computation will be very slow in that
case.
